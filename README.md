[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tinypkg.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tinypkg)

- a tiny packaging example that only has a [pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) w/[setuptools üî®](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools)
- üéâ setuptools [v61.0.0](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/releases/tag/v61.0.0) is released with experimental support for `pyproject.toml`
  - see https://discuss.python.org/t/help-testing-experimental-features-in-setuptools/

### ü¶æ motivation
- we can find lots of packaging examples with `poetry`, `pdm`, etc., but hard to find examples with the standard `setuptools` based on the latest PEP supports.

### ‚úîÔ∏è confirmed versions
- `Ubuntu 20.04` `Mac OS X 11.6.4`
- `python 3.7.*, 3.8.*, 3.9.*`
- `pip 22.0.4+`

### ‚¨áÔ∏è install locally
- clone this repo
- `$ pip install .` or `$ pip install .[dev]` (for testing)
- `$ pip show tinypkg`

### üë©‚Äçüîß testing
- `$ pip install .[dev]`
- `$ python -m pytest --cov`

### :octocat: install from GitHub.com
- `pip install git+https://github.com/denkiwakame/py-tiny-pkg`

### üìù editable install (-e)

```
ERROR: Project file:///../tiny-py-pkg has a 'pyproject.toml' and its build backend is missing the 'build_editable' hook. Since it does not have a 'setup.py' nor a 'setup.cfg', it cannot be installed in editable mode. Consider using a build backend that supports PEP 660.
```

- workaround: **locate `setup.py` that contains the following lines:** and then `$ pip install -e .`

```python
from setuptools import setup
setup()
```

- in near future, editable install will work on projets that only have a `pyproject.toml`
  - üìë PEP660 https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/
  - pip 21.1+ supports `build_editable` hook https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/#editable-installation
  - setuptools support (wip) https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2816

### ‚ùì How can I manage ext_modules ?
- `pyproject.toml` does not strictly intend to replace `setup.py` .
- If you need to build C/C++ extension modules w/[pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) or something, write the following `setup.py` (dynamic config) alongside with the `pyproject.toml` (metadata file).

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

from setuptools import Extension, setup
from setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext

class CMakeExtension(Extension):
    def __init__(self, name, sourcedir=""):
        Extension.__init__(self, name, sources=[])
        self.sourcedir = os.path.abspath(sourcedir)

class CMakeBuild(build_ext):
    def build_extension(self, ext):
        cfg = "Debug" if self.debug else "Release"  # TODO
        extdir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(
            self.get_ext_fullpath(ext.name)))
        cmake_args = [
            f"-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY={extdir}",
            f"-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE={sys.executable}",
            f"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={cfg}",
        ]
        build_args = []
        if not os.path.exists(self.build_temp):
            os.makedirs(self.build_temp)
        subprocess.check_call(
            ["cmake", ext.sourcedir] + cmake_args, cwd=self.build_temp
        )
        subprocess.check_call(
            ["cmake", "--build", "."] + build_args, cwd=self.build_temp
        )
setup(
    ext_modules=[CMakeExtension("bindings")],
    cmdclass={"build_ext": CMakeBuild},
)
```
