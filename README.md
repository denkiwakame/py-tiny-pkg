[![publish](https://github.com/denkiwakame/py-tiny-pkg/actions/workflows/pub.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/denkiwakame/py-tiny-pkg/actions/workflows/pub.yml)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tinypkg.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tinypkg)

- a tiny packaging example that only have a [pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) w/[setuptools üî®](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools)
- **NOTE:** this repository uses [experimental release of setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1688)
  - will be replaced with an official release version in future

### ü¶æ motivation
- we can find lots of packaging examples with `poetry`, `pdm`, etc., but hard to find examples with the standard `setuptools` based on the latest PEP supports.

### ‚úîÔ∏è confirmed versions
- `Ubuntu 20.04` `Mac OS X 11.6.4`
- `python 3.7.*, 3.8.*, 3.9.*`
- `pip 22.0.4+`

### ‚¨áÔ∏è install locally
- clone this repo
- `$ python -m venv .venv`
- `$ source .venv/bin/activate`
- `$ pip install .` or `$ pip install .[dev]` (for testing)
- `$ pip show tinypkg`

### üë©‚Äçüîß testing
- `$ pip install .[dev]`
- `$ python -m pytest --cov`

### :octocat: install from GitHub.com
- `pip install git+https://github.com/denkiwakame/py-tiny-pkg`

### üìù editable install (-e)

```
ERROR: Project file:///../tiny-py-pkg has a 'pyproject.toml' and its build backend is missing the 'build_editable' hook. Since it does not have a 'setup.py' nor a 'setup.cfg', it cannot be installed in editable mode. Consider using a build backend that supports PEP 660.
```

- workaround: **locate `setup.py` that contains the following lines:** and then `$ pip install -e .`

```python
from setuptools import setup
setup()
```

- in near future, editable install will work on projets that only have a `pyproject.toml`
  - üìë PEP660 https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/
  - pip 21.1+ supports `build_editable` hook https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/#editable-installation
  - setuptools support (wip) https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2816

### üì¶ publish to PyPI
- use [pypa/build](https://github.com/pypa/build), a simple PEP 517 frontend and [pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish)
